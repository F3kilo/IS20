# IS20 Token Standard Specification

The InfinitySwap (IS20) token standard is a fungible token standard for the
Internet Computer (IC). This standard is an
extension of the ICRC-1 standard and also includes some methods from Ethereum's ERC20 token standard.

Key points:
* compatible with ICRC-1 standard
* ERC20 methods `mint`, `burn` and `transfer`
* batch transfers
* possibility to provide user-claimable rewards for airdrops to account-identifiers
* cycle auctions

An implementation may choose not to provide some or all the optional methods of this standard.

## Accounts and balances

The users on IC are identified by their `Principal`. Every principal can have multiple `subaccounts` associated with it.
Subaccounts are identified by an arbitrary 32-byte byte array. The subaccount with all bytes set to 0 is a `default
subaccount`. Whenever a subaccount is not specified for an operation, the default subaccount will be used.

So an account is fully specified by a `Principal` and `Subaccount`:

```candid "Type definitions" +=
type Subaccount = blob;
type Account = record { owner : principal; subaccount : opt Subaccount; };
```

The balances of accounts are stored as unsigned integer values. For convenience of representation, the number of decimal
digits can be specified.

## Methods

### ICRC-1 methods

The ICRC-1 standard must be fully supported. Refer to the standard specification for detailed description of the methods:

* `icrc1_name`
* `icrc1_symbol`
* `icrc1_decimals`
* `icrc1_fee`
* `icrc1_metadata`
* `icrc1_total_supply`
* `icrc1_minting_account`
* `icrc1_balance_of`
* `icrc1_transfer`
* `icrc1_supported_standards`

#### Notes

1. `icrc1_supported_standards` return value must include these entries:
    * `record { name = "ICRC-1"; url = "https://github.com/dfinity/ICRC-1" }`
    * `record { name = "IS20"; url = "https://github.com/infinity-swap/is20" }`
2. ICRC-1 uses a single method for minting, burning and transferring tokens. This is done by appointing a special
   **minting account**. When a transaction is made from this account or to this account, the tokens are created or
   removed, and the balance of the minting account remains unchanged. Also the minting account is the receiver of the
   fees. IS20 standard separates the owner of the token canister (minting account) and the receiver of the fees. It also
   allows the owner (minting account) to have non-zero balance, as IS20 `transfer`, `burn` and `mint` operations work
   with this account the same way as with other accounts. Also if the owner is set to be the receiver of the fees, the
   fees are added to the account balance and not burned (as per ICRC-1).

### IS20 transfers

#### `mint`

Creates new tokens to the user. Only the owner of the canister can call this method.

Arguments:
* `to: Principal` - principal to which account to add created tokens
* `subaccount: opt Subaccount` - subaccount of the `to` principal to mint token
* `amount: Nat` - amount to mint

The returned value is the ID of the mint transaction.
 
```
mint : (principal, opt Subaccount, nat) -> (variant { Ok : nat; Err : TxError });
```

#### `burn`

Deletes the given amount of tokens.

Arguments:
* `holder: opt Principal` - the principal to remove the tokens from. If not specified, the tokens are removed from the
  caller's account. Only token canister owner can burn tokens of other principal. All other accounts can burn only 
  their own tokens. In the case a burn is requested for another principal's account and the caller is not the owner,
  `TxError::Unauthorized` error is returned.
* `subaccount: opt Subaccount` - subaccount to burn from
* `amount: Nat` - amount to burn

The returned value is the ID of the burn transaction.

```
burn : (opt principal, opt Subaccount, nat) -> (variant { Ok : nat; Err : TxError });
```

#### `transfer`

Transfers tokens from one account to another. This method works exactly as `icrc1_transfer`, but does not make a
distinction between minting account and any other account.

```
type TransferArgs = record {
  to : Account;
  fee : opt nat;
  memo : opt vec nat8;
  from_subaccount : opt vec nat8;
  created_at_time : opt nat64;
  amount : nat;
};

transfer : (TransferArgs) -> (variant { Ok : nat; Err : TxError });
```

#### `batch_transfer`

Makes multiple transfers at once. This method must guarantee that either all or none of the transfers succeed. If one of
the transactions fails, an error is returned and none of the transactions is applied.

```
type BatchTransferArgs = record { amount : nat; receiver : Account };

batch_transfer : (opt vec nat8, vec BatchTransferArgs) -> (variant { Ok : vec nat64; Err : TxError });
```

### Claimable tokens (optional)

Sometimes we want to pay another user tokens on request. ERC20 standard provides `approve` and
`transferFrom` methods for that. IS20 tokens may include a `claim` method which provides similar functionality.

Tokens holder can transfer their tokens to an ID derived from the claimer `Principal`. If that
principal then calls the `claim` method, the tokens will be transferred from holder's subbaccount to the claimer's
account (default subaccount). Until the tokens are claimed the holder has full control of those tokens.

The subaccount ID is calculated by the following algorithm:

```
1. Let claimer's principal id be `principal_id` - byte array of max length of 29 bytes.
2. Let claimer's subbaccount `claimer_subaccount` be an arbitrary 32-byte long byte string. If not specified, use the value of [0; 32];
3. Take SHA224 hash of concatenation of bytes:
    1. b"\x0Aaccount-id"
    2. principal_id
    3. claimer_subaccount
  The result `hash` is a byte array of length 28.
4. Calculate 4 byte CRC32 checksum of the `hash`.
5. Return concatenation of `checksum` and `hash`.
```

(Note that this is the algorithm to calculate ICP AccountIdentifier "address")

The method `get_claim_subaccount` can be used to get the subaccount id to transfer tokens to.

#### `get_claim_subaccount`

Returns the `Subaccount` id to put the tokens to to make them claimable by the Principal.

```
get_claim_subaccount : (principal, opt Subaccount) -> (vec nat8) query;
```

#### `get_claimable_amount`

Returns the amount of tokens that can be claimed with the given arguments.

```
get_claimable_amount : (principal, opt Subaccount) -> (nat) query;
```

#### `claim`

Transfers the tokens from a claimable subaccount to the main account of the caller. If there are no claimable tokens for
the given subaccount, `TxError::NothingToClaim` error is returned.

```
claim : (principal, opt Subaccount) -> (variant { Ok : nat; Err : TxError });
```

### Cycle auctions (optional)

Since IC uses reverse gas model to pay for incoming requests, it's important for token canisters to provide a way to
incentivise users to top it up with cycles. Cycle auctions allow users to exchange canister cycles for a share of the
fees collected for the token transactions.

An auction is performed in regular intervals set by the `set_auction_period` method. At the beginning of the auction period
`fee_ratio` value is calculated for this period. During this auction period `auction_fees = fee * fee_ratio` share of
the transaction fees are transferred to the auction account and stored until the auction.

During the auction period users can top up the token canister with cycles using `bid_cycles` method. Their bids are
saved for the auction period.

At the end of the auction period, the `auction_fees` are distributed between the bidders in proportion to the amount of
cycles they bid.

#### Common types

```
type AuctionError = variant {
  NoBids;
  TooEarlyToBeginAuction : nat64;
  Unauthorized : text;
  BiddingTooSmall;
  AuctionNotFound;
};
```

#### `bid_cycles`

Top up the token canister with cycles to participate in the auction. This method must be called with cycles, e.g. though
a cycle wallet. The argument of the method is the user principal for whom the bid is being made (this will be different
from the `caller`, becuase the `caller` in this case is a wallet canister).

```
bid_cycles : (principal) -> (variant { Ok : nat64; Err : AuctionError });
```

#### `bidding_info`

Provides bidding information for the current auction cycle.

```
type BiddingInfo = record {
  caller_cycles : nat64;
  auction_period : nat64;
  last_auction : nat64;
  total_cycles : nat64;
  fee_ratio : float64;
};
bidding_info : () -> (BiddingInfo);
```

#### `set_auction_period`

Sets the interval with which the cycles auctions are held. This method can only be called by the canister owner.

```
set_auction_period : (Interval) -> (variant { Ok; Err : AuctionError });
```

### Transactions history

The token canister must provide these methods to retrieve the transaction history. Implementations can choose to limit
the maximum length of the transaction history they store. If the requested transaction ids are out of the range of
stored length, an empty array should be returned (not an error).
  
#### Common types

```
type TxRecord = record {
  to : Account;
  fee : nat;
  status : TransactionStatus;
  from : Account;
  memo : opt vec nat8;
  operation : Operation;
  timestamp : nat64;
  caller : principal;
  index : nat64;
  amount : nat;
};
```

#### `get_transaction`

Returns the transaction with the given id.

```
get_transaction : (nat64) -> (TxRecord) query;
```
  
#### `get_transactions`

Get an array of transaction. The transactions are returned in reversed order, starting from last to first.

Arguments:
* `principal: opt Principal` - if set, only the transactions in which the given principal participated are returned
  (e.g. the transactions in which the principal was either sender or receiver of the tokens)
* `count: nat64` - number of transactions to return. The canister can choose to limit maximum number it would return. In
  case this argument value exceeds this limit, the max number of transactions is returned.
* `skip: opt nat64` - number of transactions to skip (so the latest `skip` transactions will be skipped and `[skip + 1,
  skip + 1 + count]` last transactions will be returned).

```
get_transactions : (opt principal, nat64, opt nat64) -> (
  PaginatedResult,
) query;
```
    
#### `history_size`

Returns the total number of transactions made in the token canister. This value will always be `last_transaction_id + 1`.

```
history_size : () -> (nat64) query;
```
