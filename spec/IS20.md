# Token Standard Spec

The InfinitySwap (IS20) token standard is based on the Ethereum ERC20 standard and is compatible
with the DIP20 token standard.

The main additions to the DIP20 are [transaction notification](#Transaction notifications)
and [cycle auction](#Cycle auctions) methods. All other changes in comparison to DIP20 marked in
this document with `DIP20 compatability` note.

# Rational

ERC20 is a well established and widely used token standard in Ethereum ecosystem. Internet Computer
environment introduces a few changes though, that do not allow using ERC20 tokens in IC as is:

1. Reverse gas model, requiring the token smart contracts (canisters) to pay for all incoming requests.
   This makes it possible to drain the canister of cycles with a lot of empty update calls.
2. Asynchronous nature of all inter-canister calls make it impossible to use ERC20 tokens in operations
   like AMM flash swaps.

To deal with the first issue, IS20 adds the notion of transaction fee. This fee is set by the canister
owner and is collected on each transaction. A portion of the fee is then used for cycle auctions,
providing decentralized method to provide cycles for the canister.

# Message inspection

To prevent possible DDOS attacks, the IS20 allows any update methods to reject ingress messages if the request seems
unreasonable. In this case IC will return `403` error to the caller.

The default implementation introduces following checks:

* all methods that are available only for the owner are rejected, if the caller is not the owner
* all transaction methods are rejected, if the calling user does not have any balance
* cycles auction can be run only by the owner or by any of the cycle bidders


# History limit

The stored transaction history can be limited to some value. The older transactions than can be removed
from the storage and be forgotten about. If such transactions are queried, an empty response is
produced.

The default implementation has the history length limit of `1 000 000` entries.

# ICRC-1 Token Standard.

The new ICRC-1 token standard has new changes to accounts, a principal can have multiple accounts. Each account of a
principal
is identified by a 32-byte string called subaccount. Therefore, an account corresponds to
a `pair (principal, subaccount)`
.

The account identified by the subaccount with all bytes set to 0 is the default account of the principal.

### AccountIdentifier

`AccountIdentifier` is composed of a `principal` and a `subaccount`.

### Subaccount

`Subaccount` is a 32-byte string. It is used to identify an account of a `principal`.

# API specification

## Data Structures

1. Metadata: basic token information

```
type Metadata = {
   name : text; // token name
   symbol : text; // token symbol
   decimals : nat8; // token decimal
   owner : principal; // token owner
   logo : text; // base64 encoded logo or logo url
   fee : Tokens128; // fee for update calls
}
```

2. TxError: error response for transaction related methods.

```
type TxError = variant {
    InsufficientBalance,
    Unauthorized,
    AmountTooSmall,
    FeeExceededLimit,
    AlreadyActioned,
    BadFee,
    InsufficientFunds,
    TxTooOld,
    TxCreatedInFuture,
    TxDuplicate,
    SelfTransfer,
    AmountOverflow,
    AccountNotFound,
    ClaimNotAllowed,
    GenericError
};
```

3. TxRecord: transaction history record

```
type Operation = variant {
  Burn;
  Mint;
  Auction;
  Transfer;
};

type TransactionStatus = variant {
  Failed;
  Succeeded
};

type TxRecord = record {
  fee : Tokens128;
  status : TransactionStatus;
  from_details : opt(Principal, Subaccount);
  to_details : opt (Principal, Subaccount);
  operation : Operation;
  timestamp : int;
  caller : Principal;
  index : Tokens128;
  amount : Tokens128;
};
```

3. Transfer Arguments

```
type TransferArgs = record {
  from_subaccount : opt Subaccount;
  to : Principal;
  to_subaccount : opt Subaccount;
  amount : Tokens128;
  fee : opt Tokens128;
  memo : opt u64;
  created_at_time : opt Timestamp;
};

type Timestamp = int;

```



## 2. Basic Interfaces

### Update calls

The update calls described in this section might choose to charge `fee` amount of tokens to prevent DDoS attack, this is
necessary because of the reverse gas model of the IC. All update functions are allowed to trap, instead of returning an
error in order to take advantage of the canisters automatic, atomic state rollback.

#### transfer methods

##### icrc_transfer

This transfer method has optional `to_subaccount` and `from_subaccount`, if both are specified, the transfer happens
between the two subaccount.
It transfers `value` amount of tokens from the `from` subaccount to the `to` subaccount.
If one of the subaccount is specified either as `to` or `from`, the transfer happens to the specified subaccount.
if neither `to` nor `from` subaccount is specified, the transfer happens `to` Principal .

`memo` provides a way to attach a message to the transaction.

This method returns a `TxReceipt` which contains the transaction index or an error message. The balance of the caller is
reduced by `value + fee` amount.

To protect the caller from unexpected fee amount change, the optional `fee_limit` parameter can be given. If the
fee to be applied is larger than this value, the transaction will fail with `TxError::FeeExceededLimit` error.

```
update icrc1_tranfer(transfer: TransferArgs) -> TxReceipt;
```

#### batch_transfer

Transfers the specified amount to a list of principals. This operation is transactional, meaning that either all or none
of the transfers will be executed. The fee (if configured by the token) is taken from every transaction, so total fee
amount will be `transfers.len() * fee`.

The balance of the caller is reduced by sum of `value + fee` amount for each transfer. If the total sum of `value + fee`
for all transfers,
is less than the `balance` of the caller, the transaction will fail with `TxError::InsufficientBalance` error.

```
update batch_transfer(transfers: vec record {principal, Tokens128}) : enum { ok : vec Tokens128; err : TxError }
```

### Query calls

#### get_transaction

Returns transaction detail of the transaction identified by `index`. If the `index` is out of range, the execution
traps. Transactions are indexed from zero.

```
query func get_transaction(index: u128) : TxRecord
```

#### get_transactions

Returns a list of transactions in paginated form. The `who` is optional and returns the transactions of the specified
principal, including the transactions occuring from subaccounts.
`count` is the number of transactions to return, `transaction_id` is the transaction index which is used as
the offset of the first transaction to return.

It returns `PaginatedResult` a struct, which contains `result` which is a list of transactions `Vec<TxRecord>` that meet
the requirements of the query,
and `next_id` which is the index of the next transaction to return.

```
query get_transactions(who: opt principal,  count: u32, transaction_id: opt u128) : PaginatedResult
```

#### name

Returns the name of the token.

OPTIONAL: the consumers of the API must not expect this value to be present.

```
query icrc1_name() : text
```

#### logo

Returns the logo of the token as URL link or base64 encoded image (with "base64,..." prefix).

OPTIONAL: the consumers of the API must not expect this value to be present.

```
query logo() : Text
```

#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token, e.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL: the consumers of the API must not expect this value to be present.

```
query icrc1_symbol() : text
```

#### decimals

Returns the decimals of the token, e.g. `8` means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its
user representation.

OPTIONAL: the consumers of the API must not expect this value to be present.

```
query icrc1_decimals() : async nat8
```

#### icrc1_total_supply

Returns the total supply of the token.

```
query icrc1_total_supply() : Tokens128
```

#### icrc1_balance_of

##### (icrc1 standard)

Returns the balance of user `who` and optional `who_subaccount` if specified.

```
type BalanceArgs {
  of: Principal;
  subaccount: opt Subaccount;
}

```
query icrc1_balance_of(args: BalanceArgs) : Tokens128
```

#### get_metadata

Returns the metadata of the token.

```
query get_metadata() : Metadata
```
##### icrc1_metadata (icrc1 standard)

Returns the metadata of the token.

```
type Value = variant { Nat : nat; Int : int; Text : text; Blob : blob };
icrc1_metadata : () -> (vec { record { text; Value } }) query;

```

#### history_size

Returns the history size.

```
query history_size() : u64
```

#### owner

Returns the owner of the canister.

```
query owner() -> principal;
```

## Optional interfaces

### Update calls

#### mint

##### mint

Mint `value` number of new tokens to user `to` with their respective subaccount if specified, if the `to_subaccount` is not specified, the `value` is minted to the default subaccount.


```
update icrc1_mint(to: principal, to_subaccount: opt Subaccount , value: Tokens128): TxReceipt
```

#### burn

##### burn

Burn `value` number of new tokens from user `from` with their respective specified subaccount, if `from_subaccount` is not specified, the tokens will be burned from the defauly `from` subaccount, this will decrease the token total supply, only `owner` or the
user `from` him/herself can perform this operation.
If `from` is not set, then caller's tokens will be burned.
If `from` is given but method called not by owner, `TxError::Unauthorized` will be returned.
If owner calls this method and `from` is set to `Bob`, then `Bob`'s tokens will be burned.

```
update icrc1_burn(from: opt principal, from_subaccount: opt Subaccount, value: Tokens128): TxReceipt
```

`aaaaa-aa` is the IC management canister id, it's not a real canister, just an abstraction of system level management
functions, it can be used as Blackhole address.

#### set_name

Change the name of the token, no return value needed.

```
update set_name(name: text)
```

#### set_symbol

Change the name of the token, no return value needed.

```
update set_symbol(symbol: text)
```

#### set_logo

Change the logo of the token, no return value needed. The `logo` can either be a base64 encoded text of the logo picture
or an URL pointing to the logo picture.

```
update set_logo(logo: text)
```

#### set_fee

Set fee to `newFee` for update calls(`approve`, `transfer`, `transfer_from`), no return value needed.

```
update set_fee(newFee: nat)
```

#### set_fee_to

Set fee receiver to `newFeeTo` , no return value needed.

```
update set_fee_to(newFeeTo: principal)
```

#### set_owner

Set the owner of the token to `newOwner`, no return value needed.

```
update set_owner(newOwner: principal)
```

### Query calls

#### get_user_transaction_amount

Returns total number of transactions related to the user `who`, it returns with all the transactions of the user, including the transactions of subaccounts.



```
query get_user_transaction_amount(who: principal) : async Tokens128
```
